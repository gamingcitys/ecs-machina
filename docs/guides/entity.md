# Entity

Entities are literally nothing more than a reference id. As such, they do absolutely nothing by themselves, and all actions on Entities are executed from the [World](./world) instance or frm the related [Systems](./system).

:::tip
You can use the custom type `Entity`, which is an alias of `string`
